# concourse-rclone-resource

A Concourse CI resource that executes [`rclone`](https://rclone.org/) 
against a remote host.

See [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/sothr/concourse-rclone-resource)
for tagged image versions available.

## Resource Type Configuration

```bash
resource_types:
- name: rclone
  type: registry-image
  source:
    repository: docker.io/sothr/concourse-rclone-resource
    tag: latest
```

## Source Configuration

* `config`: Required. The rclone config file contents to use.
* `password`: Optional. Encryption password used for encrypted rclone configurations. Please use secrets management for this value.
* `files`: Optional. Additional files to write to the /tmp/rclone directory. This is a map of key/value pairs for the filename and contents of that file.

### Example

```bash
resources:
- name: rclone
  type: rclone
  source:
    config: |
      [remote]
      client_id = <Your ID>
      client_secret = <Your Secret>
      scope = drive
      root_folder_id = <Your root folder id>
      service_account_file = /tmp/rclone/serviceAccountFile
      token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2014-03-16T13:57:58.955387075Z"}
    files:
      serviceAccountFile: |
        ...contents...
```

### Note

It's highly recommended to use secrets mangement to avoid storing sensitive credentials in the pipeline
